## React SSR

Server side-rendering is crucial for a whole lot of reasons.

Explain in your own words why it is crucial and how you would approach it.

## Answer

SSR is crucial because good user experience increases upon faster loading (satisfaction) on slower devices.
With current applications storming towards SPA (Single Page Applications) and PWA (progressive Web Apps) it's more and more important to Get the page loaded as soon as possible. Next to that, to correctly have SEO and index a site an application needs fully matured HTML bodies.

The implementation for example react applications, would be to use either a framework like Next.js or if their would already be a app running I would hydrate the App and use Babel to transpile the code correctly.
