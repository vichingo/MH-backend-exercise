# Mediahuis Backend Exercise

This is an all-round exercise to test several facets of your programming skills. You shouldn't spend more than 3 hours on it. If you don't finish the exercise in this timeframe, that's no issue as long as you can write down/explain how you would further finish the exercise.

Don't worry too much about the code you produce, there is **no correct solution**. We will have a chat about this exercise to talk about shortcuts you might have made.

## How it's structured

This repository contains three folders, each representing a different exercise. Two of them are technical, while a third is conceptual.

Fork this repository and complete each exercise in its folder. There is only one rule: you must use JavaScript for all technical exercises. There are no other rules: you can use any starter-kit, you can use Google/StackOverflow, any other libraries, anything else that you would use for day-to-day programming.

Good luck!
